Overview
--------------------------------------------
* Name: MAX7219_7SEG_RPI
* Author: Gavin Lyons.

* Description:

A Raspberry pi library to display data on a 8-digit MAX7219 seven segment module.
Dynamic install-able system level Raspberry Pi C++ library.

* Developed on
	1. Raspberry PI 3 model b,
	2. C++ , complier g++ (Raspbian 8.3.0-6+rpi1) 8.3.0
	3. Raspbian 10 buster OS , armv7l Linux 5.10.103-v7+
	4. bcm2835 Library 1.71 (Dependency: used for GPIO control and delays)


Installation
------------------------------

1. Install the dependency bcm2835 Library if not installed
	* The bcm2835 library is a dependency and provides delays and GPIO control.
	* Install the C libraries of bcm2835, [Installation instructions here](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/)

2. Download the MAX7219_7SEG_RPI library
	* Open a Terminal in a folder where you want to download,build & test library
	* Run following command to download from github.

```sh
curl -sL https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/MAX7219_7SEG_RPI/archive/1.0.tar.gz | tar xz
```

4. Run "make" to run the makefile in base folder to make and install library, it will be
    installed to usr/lib and usr/include

```sh
cd MAX7219_7SEG_RPI-1.0
make
sudo make install
```

Test
--------------------------------

Wire up your Display.
Next step is to test LED display and the just installed library with an example file.

There are 2 examples files. The default example file is  "hello world".
To decide which one the makefile(In examples folder) builds simply edit "SRC" variable
at top of the makefile(In examples folder). 
in the "User SRC directory Option Section" at top of file.

|  List No | example file name  |  Description |
| ------ | ------ |   ------ |
| 1 | src/HELLOWORLD/main.cpp | Hello world |
| 2 | src/TESTS/main.cpp |  test sequence  |


Next enter the examples folder and run the makefile in THAT folder,
This makefile builds the examples file using the just installed library.
and creates a test exe file in "bin".

```sh
cd examples
make
make run
```

Software
---------------------------------

**API**

The API (application programming interface) documentation is at link hosted on github pages and generated by Doxygen. 

[ URL](https://gavinlyonsrepo.github.io/misc/software_docs/MAX7219_7SEG_RPI/index.html) 

There are two makefiles:

    1. Root directory, builds and installs library at a system level.
    2. Example directory, builds example file using installed library to an executable.

Hardware
----------------------

Software SPI only at present. Pick any GPIO you want.
User may need to increase or decrease _CommDelay  variable (uS Communication delay) depending on speed 
of CPU on system. 
 
Connections to RPI:

1. GPIO output => CLK = Clock
2. GPIO output => CS  = Chip select
3. GPIO output => DIN = Data in
4. GND
5. VCC 5V in theory but works at 3.3V, albeit with a dimmer display.

Logic seems to work fine at 3.3V , it safe as it is all one way communications
From RPI to MAX. 


Notes
------------------------------

TODO

1. Hardware SPI
2. Support for Cascaded Displays.
